Hello! This is the repository of Naomi J. Sutcliffe de Moraes, PhD

I'm currently working on large language models, generative AI, machine learning, natural language processing, algorithm development and the application of these fields to engineering, education and public health.

I'm also learning Mandarin (with traditional characters) for fun! I am always learning one language or another.

Fun fact: I like 100% dark chocolate. The other kinds just don't seem very chocolaty to me.
